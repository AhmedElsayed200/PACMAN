# PACMAN
PAC-MAN should escape from the ghosts and reach the red door to win and pass the level. 
## The game is divided into four levels. 
- First level: ghosts move randomly on the map
- Second level: Ghosts reach Pacman (DFS)
- Third level: ghosts reach Pacman with the shortest path (BFS)
- Fourth level: Ghosts surround Pacman
PAC-MAN should reach the red door very quickly to achieve a high score.
